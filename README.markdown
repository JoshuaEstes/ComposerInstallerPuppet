# Composer Installer Puppet

This installer is used to manage puppet modules in your projects. Why
would you want to do this? I use vagrant for some of my projects and
I have a few of my own custom modules that I use. I don't want to set
up the project as a puppet master/agent so I just have the manifests
run locally.
